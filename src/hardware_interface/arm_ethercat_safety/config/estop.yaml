# Emergency stop configuration

estop:
  # Hardware GPIO pin for physical e-stop button
  # Set to -1 if no hardware e-stop is connected (software-only mode)
  gpio_pin: -1

  # Debounce time for GPIO input (ms)
  debounce_ms: 10

  # Reaction when e-stop is triggered:
  #   "quickstop"         — CiA 402 quick stop (controlled deceleration via 0x605A)
  #   "immediate_disable" — set control word to 0x0000 (drives coast to stop)
