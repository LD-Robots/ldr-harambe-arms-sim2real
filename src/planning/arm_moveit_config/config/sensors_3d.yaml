  # Reference frame for the sensor (camera optical frame)
  # Point cloud Z-axis filtering is relative to THIS frame
  # For depth cameras: +Z points INTO the scene (away from camera)
  #                    -Z points BACK towards the camera
 
  # Z-axis filtering (in camera_depth_optical_frame)
  # IMPORTANT: Only accept points in FRONT of camera (positive Z)
  point_cloud_min_z: 0.1       # Minimum 10cm in front of camera (avoid noise at lens)
  point_cloud_max_z: 3.0       # Maximum 3m range (typical workspace depth)
 
  # Range limits
  max_range: 5.0               # Maximum sensor range (meters)
 
  # Point cloud downsampling for performance
  # 1 = no downsampling (use all points)
  # 2 = use every 2nd point (4x faster)
  # 4 = use every 4th point (16x faster)
  point_subsample: 1           # No downsampling for accuracy
 
  # Collision padding (safety margin around detected obstacles)
  padding_offset: 0.05         # 5cm safety padding
  padding_scale: 1.0           # Linear padding scale
 
  # Update rate
  max_update_rate: 5.0         # Process point clouds at 5 Hz (real-time)
 
  # Free space detection - CRITICAL for dynamic environments
  # Raycasting marks voxels between camera and obstacles as FREE
  # This allows the map to clear when objects are removed
